# TODO
- [ ] Write report tool
- [x] "Screenshot" shapes to embed them in spritesheet
- [ ] Embed text font (optional)
- [x] config json: targeted dimension, font embed, font targeted dimension
- [ ] Create a watcher that watch every SWF inside a folder and auto-export
- [ ] Generate multiple version (low res, medium res, high res)
- [x] Add config json to specify target max resolution and auto scale down
- [ ] Support color transform
- [ ] Calculate max scale if sprite is non-root (object that were scaled down will use less space in texture)
- [ ] When calculating min/max scale also create version if necessary at every double size
- [ ] pngquant (sys only)
- [ ] support for converting the bitmapdata to other compressed texture format (especially for mobile)
- [ ] support frame
- [ ] Detect missing font
- [ ] Rewrite IDs to be sequentials (starts at 1)
- [ ] Do binary format with table of offset to look for id (bitmaps, sprites, fonts)
- [ ] Zoom level on bitmap font (between 10-20 use font at 15)
- [ ] Localization of fonts with reserve space on the texture (it would be transparent and so will be trimmed, filesize would be low, compressed in pngs and shared between all swftys, optional)
- [ ] Add full colortransform support
- [ ] Add blendMode support (screenshot was a failed, which is very obvious now)
