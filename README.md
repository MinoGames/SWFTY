**WIP** *Not to be used in production yet, PRs, issues, etc. are very much welcome*

## Purpose
Create a cross-engine high-performance SWF rendering layer (no code, graphics only) using Spritesheet (1 draw call per SWF).

Can facilitate migration from OpenFL to Heaps.

Currently works on Heaps and OpenFL.

## TODO
Create a README with online (HTML5) example
